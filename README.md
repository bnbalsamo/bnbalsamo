# :man_technologist: Software Stuff 

I love building software that solves problems and helping others to do the same.

Some of my favorite technologies include...

- :snake: Python
- :penguin: Linux
- :whale: Containers
- :left_right_arrow: APIs

... though I've dabbled with plenty of others, and I'm always excited to learn about new
technologies and hone my existing skills!

:star: One of the projects that I'm having the most fun working on right now is 
my [python project template](https://github.com/bnbalsamo/cookiecutter-pypackage),
which lets others (and me!) create python projects here on GitHub which leverage a
bunch of cool software and services in order to write better software!
